Simple Bitcoin Wallet (aka SBW) is an [IMMORTAN](https://github.com/btcontract/IMMORTAN)-powered non-custodial Bitcoin wallet for Android with extensive Lightning Network support. It is fully autonomus and does not rely on any kind of centralized service (such as Google services, routing servers, special LSP nodes etc). It is the first mobile wallet which supports routing of 3rd-party Lightning payments and thus allows users to avoid private channel closings as well as earn routing fees in a non-custodial way.

## Building from source

```
git clone https://github.com/btcontract/wallet.git
cd wallet
git checkout 3.7.0
podman build -t sbw .
podman run -v $PWD:/app/simplebitcoinwallet/wallet:z sbw
```

### Signing with your self-signed certificate

Install Android SDK, create a `keystore.jks` using `keytool`.

```
$ <Android SDK dir>/build-tools/<version>/zipalign -v 4 app/build/outputs/apk/release/SBW-3.0.0.apk app/build/outputs/apk/release/SBW-3.0.0-aligned.apk

$ <Android SDK dir>/build-tools/<version>/apksigner sign --ks <path to keystore.jks> --ks-key-alias <signing key alias> --v1-signing-enabled true --v2-signing-enabled true app/build/outputs/apk/release/SBW-3.0.0-aligned.apk
```

## Verification with `apksigner`

```
$ '<Android SDK dir>/build-tools/<version>/apksigner' verify --print-certs --verbose SBW-3.0.0.apk
```

Output should contain the following info:

```
